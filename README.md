<h1>IT 207 - Introduction to Web Programming</h1>

<h2>Project</h2>

<p>Welcome to the repository for my solo project! Here, I am dedicated to developing a Sneaker shop web application named <strong>Elles</strong>.

Stay tuned for progress reports, and feel free to provide feedback and suggestions as I work on this exciting project!

Let's dive into coding and craft remarkable experiences! ðŸš€</p>

<h2>Milestones</h2>

  <summary><em>Milestone #2</em></summary>

  <p>
	<br>
	For milestone #2, I created a Single Page Application (SPA) in my project by following the instructions posted on the Learning Management System (LMS). Additionally, I created Ajax calls to the API and developed a functional and responsive frontend application. Below, everything is explained in detail!	

Spapp.
===============================
**Spapp** is a simple jquery plugin that help to create single page application. The principle is quite simple.
With this plugin you will load a main page wrapper that will load every other view (or if you prefer page) on url hash change.

----------


HTML
-------------
First of all, i update my HTML (index.html).
```html
<section id="pageContent">
    <main id="spapp" role="main">
      <section id="home" data-load="home.html"></section>
      <section id="shop" data-load="shop.html"></section>
      <section id="sproduct" data-load="sproduct.html"></section>
      <section id="about" data-load="about.html"></section>
      <section id="cart" data-load="cart.html"></section>
      <section id="profile" data-load="profile.html"></section>
      <section id="registration" data-load="registration.html"></section>
    </main>
  </section>
```

----------
JS
-------------
When I set html, I was write the javascript to run the plugin. (script.js) ->example: 
```js
var app = $.spapp({
  defaultView: "#shop",
  templateDir: "../../views/",
  pageNotFound: "error_404"
});

app.route({
  view: "sproduct",
  load: "sproduct.html",
  onCreate: function () {  },
  onReady: function () {
    var productId = localStorage.getItem("productId");
    $.ajax({
      url: 'assets/js/products.json',
      type: 'GET',
      dataType: 'json',
      success: function (products) {
        var product = products.find(p => p.id.toString() === productId);
        if (product) {
          document.getElementById("MainImg").src = product.image;
          document.querySelector('.single-pro-details h4').textContent = product.name;
          document.querySelector('.single-pro-details h3').textContent = `$${product.price}`;
          document.querySelector('.single-pro-details span').textContent = product.description;

        } else {
          console.error('The product is not found');
        }
      },
      error: function (error) {
        console.error('An error occurred while retrieving data', error);
      }
    });
  }
});

app.run();
```
----------

Ajax calls to the API.
===============================
**Ajax calls to the API** is a simple jquery plugin that help to create single page application. The principle is quite simple.
With this plugin you will load a main page wrapper that will load every other view (or if you prefer page) on url hash change.

----------

Functional and responsive frontend application.
===============================

**Functional frontend application** 

I designed a functional frontend application to efficiently carry out specific tasks and operations as required by users, with a strong emphasis on effectiveness and interactions within the user interface. When I created this application, I ensured that every button had its specific function, focusing on providing a clear and direct way for users to interact with the application.

**Responsive front-end application** 

When I was creating a responsive frontend application, I selected different sizes for devices: 390px, 430px, 768px, 799px, and 1280px. This ensured that the design would adapt seamlessly to different screen sizes and resolutions, providing an optimal viewing experience across various devices. The combination of functional and responsive design elements results in an application that is both useful and accessible on different devices.
