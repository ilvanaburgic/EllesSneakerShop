<h1>IT 207 - Introduction to Web Programming</h1>

<h2>Project</h2>

<p>Welcome to the repository for my solo project! Here, I am dedicated to developing a Sneaker shop web application named <strong>Elles</strong>.

Stay tuned for progress reports, and feel free to provide feedback and suggestions as I work on this exciting project!

Let's dive into coding and craft remarkable experiences! ðŸš€</p>

<h2>Milestones</h2>

<details>
  <summary><strong><em>Milestone #1</em></strong></summary>

  <h4>Frontend components of the application are:</h4>
<p>
<strong>Milestone #1</strong> <br>
For milestone #1, I created the frontend part of the application using HTML and CSS. I used JavaScript for dynamic functionalities such as "scrolling" images on the product page (sproduct.html) and for adding the add-to-cart button functionality. The cart button displays a success message and returns the user to the home page.<br>
	
In the project I have 5 HTML files, 1 CSS file and 1 JavaScript file. The files are organized as follows:
<ul>
	<li>index.html (home page)</li>
	<li>shop.html (shop page)</li>
	<li>sproduct.html (page of individual product with details)</li>
	<li>about.html (about the application)</li>
	<li>cart.html (cart)</li>
	<li>Each HTML page has a header that is the same on every page, as well as a footer that also contains the same information, including Contact, About Us, My Account, and Install App.</li>
